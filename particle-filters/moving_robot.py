# Make a robot called myrobot that starts at
# coordinates 30, 50 heading north (pi/2).
# Have your robot turn clockwise by pi/2, move
# 15 m, and sense. Then have it turn clockwise
# by pi/2 again, move 10 m, and sense again.
#
# Your program should print out the result of
# your two sense measurements.
#
# Don't modify the code below. Please enter
